<h1>his is a simple project where I built a Voting Classifier using Scikit-learn.</h1>
It combines three different models to improve prediction accuracy:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

I used the famous Iris dataset for this project.
I also compared training and testing accuracy, and plotted the results using Matplotlib.
